Introspective is a new way to explore your health data. It allows you to write custom (easy-to-understand) queries against your data and create custom graphs that can show the relationship between different pieces of your health data.

MAIN FEATURES:
- Custom queries
Explore your data in a unique way by querying for exactly the records in which you're interested. Specify complex conditions on any attribute for any supported data type by combining them using "and", "or", and condition groups (full boolean algebra support with grouping). Even better, you can limit your query further by looking at other data types within the query. For example, you can find all moods that were recorded within a half hour of socializing.

- Custom graphs
Use custom queries to specify exactly which data points you want to graph. The following graphs are available:
	- Line Chart
	- Bar Chart
	- Scatter Plot
Use queries to find trends between two different types of data (i.e. how your heart rate affects your mood).
Show multiple values (i.e. avg mood, min mood) over time in the same graph.
Specify how to group data into a single value for each point (i.e. avg mood per hour).

Privacy Policy:
From the very beginning of this project, I decided that privacy and security were the number one priorities. As such, any and all of your data NEVER leaves your phone (unless you export it).

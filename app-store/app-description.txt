Introspective is a new way to explore your health data. It allows you to write custom (easy-to-understand) queries against your data and create custom graphs that can show the relationship between different pieces of your health data.

MAIN FEATURES:
- Custom queries
Explore your data in a unique way by querying for exactly the records in which you're interested. Specify complex conditions on any attribute for any supported data type by combining them using "and", "or", and condition groups (full boolean algebra support with grouping). Even better, you can limit your query further by looking at other data types within the query. For example, you can find all moods that were recorded within a half hour of socializing.

- Custom graphs
You can also create custom graphs using queries to specify exactly which data points you want to show. The following types of graph are currently supported:
	- Line Chart
	- Bar Chart
	- Scatter Plot
On all x/y coordinate graphs, you can set a query for each axis individually or set a single query for both axes. You can also specify a way to determine what points should be grouped together into a series and whether or not (/ how) to group multiple entries into a single point.

Privacy Policy:
From the very beginning of this project, I decided that privacy and security were the number one priorities. As such, any and all of your data NEVER leaves your phone (unless you export it).
